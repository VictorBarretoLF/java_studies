Create a method that takes an integer parameter number. 
It then runs a for loop from 0 to the parameter, excluding the parameter itself. Inside the loop, it sends a message to Kafka topic `t-counter`. 
The message is a string that starts with "Data " and ends with the current loop index.
The message has no key.
