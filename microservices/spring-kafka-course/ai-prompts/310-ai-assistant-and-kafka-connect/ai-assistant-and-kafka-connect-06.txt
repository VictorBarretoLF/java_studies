Create a Kafka Connect sink connector to insert data into a PostgreSQL database. 
The connector should:
 - Connect to a Kafka cluster running on IP 127.0.01 at port 9092.
 - Use the JDBC sink connector.
 - Read data from the topic "t-person-address-postgresql".
 - Read from PostgreSQL at IP my-postgres.com, port 5432, database postgres.
 - Insert the data into table "kafka_person_address" in the PostgreSQL.
 - Automatically create the table if it does not exist. If the table exists, the table columns must be automatically updated to match the structure of the incoming data.
 - Insert or update records in the database based on the primary key. The primary key is the "address_id" field from the consumed data. 
 - Delete the database record if a null value is consumed from the Kafka topic.
